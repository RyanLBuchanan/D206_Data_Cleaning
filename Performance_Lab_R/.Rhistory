# Fixing column values
# Question 23 :
# According to business rules, all the values in the locationzone column of df should contain only two characters. The first character should be a letter between A-Z and the second character should be a number between 0-9. There are some values in the locationzone column having the incorrect second character. Write code to make the incorrect values in the locationzone column to default to 5 as the second character (example: an incorrect “BT” value would be changed to “B5”).
